# Research project: Nonlinear Transmission of Monetary Policy and Housing Market Imbalances: Evidence from a Factor-Augmented Threshold VAR Analysis

In recent decades, persistently low rates have driven housing booms and prompted questions on how market imbalances shape policy effects. In this paper, I investigate how such imbalances affect the monetary transmission in the United States. I create a stress indicator from the rent-price ratio and credit-to-GDP gap, then embed it in a factor-augmented threshold VAR with two regimes to isolate periods of high stress. I show that this framework consistently flags emerging housing bubbles. Regime-specific generalized impulse responses show somewhat larger contractions under adverse conditions, confirming the existence of the financial accelerator effect along the housing cycle. Furthermore, monetary conditions are eased more gradually around forming bubbles, suggesting that macro-financial signals should be incorporated in policy frameworks to effectively manage deleveraging high market pressure.
